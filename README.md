# Transforming Healthcare with AI-powered Disease Prediction Based on Patient Data

This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of diseases such as diabetes using patient medical data. It aims to assist early diagnosis and preventive care, making healthcare smarter and more efficient.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build an intelligent system that analyzes patient data and predicts whether an individual is at risk of having a disease. This approach helps in early detection, clinical decision support, and resource optimization in healthcare systems.

## How the Project Works

This project follows a structured machine learning workflow to predict diseases based on patient health data. The process is outlined below:

### Workflow Steps

1. **Data Loading**
   - Load the dataset (`diabetes.csv`) using pandas.
   - It includes health-related features such as Glucose, BMI, Blood Pressure, etc.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing or zero values by replacing them with column means.
   - Normalize features using `StandardScaler`.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Use plots like histograms and heatmaps to understand feature distributions.
   - Analyze feature correlations and patterns.

4. **Model Building**
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Train classification models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualize performance with a confusion matrix.

6. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Deploy the trained model using Streamlit or Flask.
   - Provide a web interface for users to enter health data and get predictions.
